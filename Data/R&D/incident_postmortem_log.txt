Incident: Search Latency Spikes
Author: Dave (Backend Lead)

Root Cause:
The search indexing service crashes if a user uploads a file specifically named "temp_null.log". This is a legacy bug in the file parser (lines 400-450 in `parser.py`).

Workaround:
Do not fix the code (too risky). We added a sanitization script that renames any file called "temp_null.log" to "temp_zero.log" automatically.
