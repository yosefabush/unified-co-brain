# Internal API Documentation - v2.1 (CONFIDENTIAL)

## GET /api/v2/export
Triggers a data dump for the authenticated user.

**Supported Formats:**
- `json` (Default)
- `csv`
- `parquet`

**DEPRECATED FORMATS:**
- `xml`: REMOVED in Hotfix v2.0.4 due to the XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability. Do NOT promise XML support to clients until the parser is rewritten (Roadmap: Q4 2025).

## Rate Limiting (Hard Limits)
While Marketing claims "unlimited," the SRE team has configured the NGINX Load Balancer to reject traffic exceeding:
- 5,000 requests per minute per IP.
- Error Code: 429 Too Many Requests.
*Note: If a strategic client hits this, they need to be added to the 'VIP_Allowlist' in the Redis config manually.*
